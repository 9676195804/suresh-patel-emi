# Recommended: create a server-side signing endpoint that returns a signature and timestamp
# and set VITE_CLOUDINARY_SIGN_URL to its URL. This keeps your API secret safe.
# Example response from the signing endpoint: { "signature": "...", "timestamp": 1234567890, "api_key": "924..." }
#
# Alternative (less secure): use an unsigned upload preset (must be whitelisted in Cloudinary)
# VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your_unsigned_upload_preset
#
# Last resort (not recommended): expose an API key (no secret) to attempt client-side uploads.
